# KILLBOT
A virus called "KILLBOT.EXE". Inspired from the Killbot level in Geometry Dash.
I really don't know what to type here so I'll just put this here.

KILLBOT.EXE is a virus which didn't actually exist and is just a story. Many people say it's real, but it is not. It's a creepypasta on subreddit r/nosleep posted by u/C1rculatum 3 years ago.

I wanted to code this myself and so I did. It doesn't actually do what the story said it did, since it was kinda hard for me to program this.
